"""mergelog
This is a custom merge driver for git. It should be called from git
with a stanza in .git.config like this:
    [merge "mergelog"]
        name = log.txt file custom merge driver
        driver = ~/scripts/merge-log %O %A %B %L
        recursive = binary
To make git use the custom merge driver you also need to put this in
.git/info/attributes:
   log.txt merge=mergelog
This tells git to use the 'mergelog' merge driver to merge files called log.txt.
